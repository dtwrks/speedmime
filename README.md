# Speed Mime Game

Just a game me and my spouse like to play with friends.

- Two teams
- Every turn someone from a team takes the lead and tries to do as many mimes as they can before the turn ends
- Only people from their won team should try to guess the answers
- After the time finishes, the other team takes the lead
- Each turn takes 60s
- The first team to guess 50 mimes, wins!
